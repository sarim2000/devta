## Pull Request

When you are finished with the changes, create a pull request.

- Mention the changes made and please add screenshots and other things if necessary,
- Reference related issues in your pull request.
- Keep your pull requests focused on a single feature or bug fix.

## How to add functionality

Following are the steps to add new functionality:

1. Create new folder inside `src\pages`.
2. Add a route to your component in `src\router\router.js`.
3. Add an option to the settings sidebar on `src\components\sidebar\sidebarLists.js`

## Good practices

Please keep this in mind when making a contribution

- Since this project doesn't have any definitive style guide due to the nature of the components, try to use similar components as a reference or reach out to the contributors if you face any issue.
- Please make use of the reusable components at `src\components` wherever applicable.
- Please make sure to name the directory the same name of your route but in camel case.
